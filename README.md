# checksumValidation
Practice with C in order to calculate an 8, 16, or 32 bit checksum on an ASCII input file

To Execute: ./pa02 inputFile.txt 8

where inputFile.txt is an ASCII input file and the number 8 could also be 16 or 32, which are the valid checksum sizes, all other values are rejected with an error message and program termination.
